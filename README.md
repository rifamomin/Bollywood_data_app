App that presents data regarding statistics of Bollywood movies
The topic of my project is understanding the relationship between certain factors of Bollywood movies and their revenue. Bollywood movies are something my family and I love to watch together, whether they’re poorly directed or some of the best cinematography, there is a certain charm to Bollywood movies that are lacking in Western media. I’d like to explore how certain factors, like genre, the main lead, or when the movie is released impact how much revenue is brought in.
The data was scraped by Prashant Premkumar and his colleagues from the Box Office India website using a Python script, and was published on Mendeley Data in 2020.

The data was provided as a CSV so I can import the dataset right into R-Studio. While the data is already organized, I will convert the values of the revenue and budget from rupees to American U.S. dollars.
